                    The feminine archetypes represent the profound depths of the sacred feminine—ancient patterns of power, wisdom, and creation that flow through every woman's psyche. Like the masculine archetypes, each feminine archetype contains within it both mature, balanced expressions and shadow manifestations that arise when the archetype is distorted or suppressed.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    This guide explores four primary feminine archetypes: the Queen, the Warrior/Huntress, the Magician/Wise Woman, and the Love Goddess. Each represents a fundamental aspect of feminine power and wisdom, offering pathways to wholeness when accessed in their mature form.

                <p class="text-lg">
                    She radiates confidence without arrogance, commands respect without demanding it, and wields power in service of the highest good. The Queen archetype represents the mature feminine capacity to create, protect, and govern with wisdom, love, and unwavering strength.

                    The Tyrant Queen represents the active shadow of the Queen archetype—feminine power corrupted by ego, control, and the need to dominate. She rules through fear, manipulation, and emotional tyranny, demanding perfection while being unable to see her own flaws.

            <h2 class="title-font text-3xl font-bold text-center text-gray-800 mb-12">Essential Virtues</h2>
            
            <!-- Sovereignty -->
            <div class="virtue-card bg-blue-50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
                <h3 class="title-font text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-4">Sovereignty</h3>
                <p class="quote-style text-center text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. - Eleanor Roosevelt
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Sovereignty is the Queen's most essential virtue—the recognition that you are the ultimate authority in your own life. True sovereignty is not about controlling others or external circumstances, but about owning your power to choose your responses, boundaries, and path.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The sovereign woman knows that her worth is inherent, not earned through others' approval. She makes decisions from her own center, guided by her values and wisdom, taking full responsibility for her life while releasing the need to control what is not hers to control.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Sacred Boundaries -->
            <div class="virtue-card bg-green-50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
                <h3 class="title-font text-2xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-4">Sacred Boundaries</h3>
                <p class="quote-style text-center text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others. - Brené Brown
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Sacred boundaries represent the Warrior/Huntress's essential skill—the ability to discern what belongs in your space and what doesn't. Boundaries are not walls that separate us from life, but sacred containers that allow us to show up authentically and sustainably.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The woman who understands sacred boundaries knows that saying "no" to what doesn't serve is saying "yes" to what does. She recognizes that her energy is finite and precious, guarding it like the treasure it is without apologizing for her limits.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Intuitive Wisdom -->
            <div class="virtue-card bg-purple-50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
                <h3 class="title-font text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-4">Intuitive Wisdom</h3>
                <p class="quote-style text-center text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. - Albert Einstein
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Intuitive wisdom represents the Magician/Wise Woman's greatest treasure—the ability to access knowledge that comes from beyond logical reasoning. This knowing arises from the deep feminine capacity to perceive patterns, energy, and truth not immediately obvious to rational analysis.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The woman who cultivates intuitive wisdom learns to trust the subtle signals her body and psyche provide, paying attention to dreams, gut feelings, and synchronicities. She understands that intuition complements logic as a different way of knowing.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Transformative Love -->
            <div class="virtue-card bg-pink-50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
                <h3 class="title-font text-2xl font-semibold text-pink-800 mb-4">Transformative Love</h3>
                <p class="quote-style text-center text-gray-600 mb-6">
                    Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage. - Lao Tzu
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Transformative love represents the Love Goddess's greatest gift—the ability to love in ways that heal, inspire, and create positive change. This goes beyond romantic love to include compassion, creativity, and the capacity to see beauty and potential in all things.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    The woman who embodies transformative love knows that love is not just a feeling but a force for healing and growth. She loves with wisdom and boundaries, understanding that true love sometimes requires difficult conversations or letting go.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The journey of feminine awakening involves recognizing and integrating all four archetypes within yourself. Each woman carries the potential for all these expressions of feminine power, and wholeness comes from developing each archetype in its mature form while healing its shadow manifestations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    As you explore these archetypes, notice which ones feel most natural to you and which feel more challenging. Both your strengths and your growing edges offer valuable information about your path to wholeness.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Remember that this is a lifelong journey of becoming. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you learn to embody the full spectrum of feminine wisdom, power, and love that is your birthright.
