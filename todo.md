-- big overall map? 

-- Image style

Semi-abstract art nouveau style feminine silhouette representing the "Aloof Sovereign" passive shadow archetype. Shows a woman's form in rigid, distant posture - standing straight with arms crossed or hands clasped behind back, surrounded by protective barriers and geometric shields. Visual elements include: crystalline geometric patterns that create walls and distance, frozen ornamental designs with sharp edges and rigid symmetry, cool marble white and silver tones with icy blue accents, crown or throne imagery that isolates rather than connects, swan motifs turned cold and unapproachable, pristine lotus flowers that never open, perfectionist patterns that create separation. The overall composition conveys dignity corrupted into emotional distance and withholding, while maintaining the elegant feminine silhouette and flowing art nouveau lines consistent with the shadow archetype collection.
